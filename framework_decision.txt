Flask Features:
- Considered lightweight and simple compared to other Python frameworks.
- Contains mostly the essentials needed for wed development.
- Requires knowledge of HTML.

Streamlit Features:
- Ideal for making data driven web apps and dashboards.
- Claims to be easy to use.
- Requires no knowledge of HTML.

My Choice & Why:
I will be going for Streamlit, I have had some exposure to the library in a previous semester and hope that the AI will not struggle with it too much.

Anticipated Challenge:
From what I have experienced in LAB.3.0 Vibe Coding I know that unless I am very specific, having the AI fix or add new things to the code can cause issues.
